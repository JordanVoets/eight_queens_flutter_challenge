# eight_queens_flutter_challenge

We want to create an app that helps users solve the eight queens puzzle. The challenge is to place eight queens on an 8 x 8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The requirements for the app are written down below but feel free to come up with creative ideas that make the app even better.
