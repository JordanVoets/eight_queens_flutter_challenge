# The Challenge
We want to create an app that helps users solve the eight queens puzzle. The challenge is to
place eight queens on an 8 x 8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The
requirements for the app are written down below but feel free to come up with creative ideas
that make the app even better.

# Requirements

## Must-haves
- The app should contain a chessboard that allows users to place the queens
- When placing the queen, users should be able to see whether their placement is valid.
  - A placement is valid when no queen is threatened by any other queen.
- If the placement is invalid, the user should see why the placement is invalid.
- Users should be able to change the placement of a queen
- When the user has correctly placed all eight queens on the board, the user should be notified that the puzzle is solved.
- The algorithm should be validated to make sure that it works correctly.
- Write the app using the Flutter framework

## Nice-to-haves
- Add the option to start the puzzle with one or more queens already randomly placed on
the board such that thereâ€™s still a valid solution to the puzzle. The user now has to find the
solution to the puzzle from that specific starting position.
